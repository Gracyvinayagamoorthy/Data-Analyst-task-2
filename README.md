# Data Analyst Internship - Task 2: Data Visualization & Storytelling

Hi! This is the submission for Task 2 of my data analyst internship. The main goal of this task was to create visualizations from a sales dataset and turn them into a meaningful story using Tableau.

## Tools Used:
- Tableau Public (Free version)
- Dataset: supermarket_sales.csv

## What I Did:
1. I explored the dataset to understand different fields like product line, city, customer type, gender, payment methods, etc.
2. I created 7 different charts in Tableau, each one focusing on a different aspect of the data.
3. Then, I combined them all into one dashboard for better understanding and to present a full picture of the insights.

## Charts Created:
- Product Line vs Total Sales
- City vs Total Sales
- Customer Type vs Total
- Gender vs Rating
- Product Line vs Gross Margin Percentage
- Payment Method vs Gross Income
- Final Dashboard (combining all )

## Key Insights:
- Food and Beverages and Health & Beauty are top-selling product lines.
- Napyitaw city had the highest total sales among the three cities.
- Male customers had slightly higher average ratings.
- Cash payment brings in the highest gross income.
- Electronic accessories had the highest gross margin.

## Files in this Repo:
- supermarket_sales.csv (dataset I used)
- Screenshots of all charts
- Final dashboard screenshot (sales_dashboard.png)
- This README file

## What I Learned:
Through this task, I learned how to choose the right charts, how to cleanly present data, and how to create a full dashboard that tells a story. It really helped me improve my Tableau skills and understand how data can be visualized effectively.
